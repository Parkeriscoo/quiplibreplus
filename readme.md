Quiplibre Plus
=========

This is Quiplibre Plus, a modded version of [Quiplibre](https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/quiplibre) and a Free Software alternative to [Quiplash](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash/)

## How do I work this?
Quiplibre Plus is available by viewing quiplibre.html in a web browser. You can either download the html file and view it locally, or visit https://parkeriscoo.github.io/quiplibreplus/ on your phone or computer or whatever.

Once you are looking at quiplibre, you will be given a chance to host a new game or join a game as a player.

NOTE: You must be connected to the internet to play quiplibre plus.

## I'm playing during a pandemic and all my friends are in different houses, can we still play?

Sure! Just open a hosting session, and then have each player including yourself open a joining session. Quiplibre is still mostly functional even without a "big screen" everyone can see.

## Can I write my own custom prompts?
Sure, just modify the prompts array in the html file. It's a big ol' list of prompts, named `prompts`. You must surround your prompt in quotation marks (either 'single' or "double") and after the closing quotation mark put a comma. Give it a shot!

You might want to make a copy of the unaltered prompts first and put it somewhere convenient, so you can go back to the default prompts easily.

## So I notice this project is missing a lot of the bells and whistles of Quiplash, such as music, timers, colors, etc
Yeah, I couldn't be bothered. If you'd like to try to spruce Quiplibre up, go right ahead :)

## What do I do if I think of a good prompt (or other contribution) I'd like to submit?
Raise an issue or submit a pull request on https://github.com/parkeriscoo/quiplibreplus. Only submit prompts you have the legal right and volition to release under the project's license, though. Don't be stealing copyrighted works to submit as Quiplash prompts!
